\noindent {\bf ANALYSIS (and math):} \\

And go into Math mode $A_x = \int_{n-1}^{n+10}  f(x) \mathrm{d}x$ 
in the normal text or insert an equation:
\begin{equation}
	F = ma \\
	   =m \frac{dv}{dt} 
\end{equation}


or if you want to go wild:
\begin{equation}
\prod_{j\ge0}\left( \sum_{k\ge0} a_{jk}z^k \right) = \sum_{n\ge0} z^n 
\left( \sum_{k_0,k_1\ldots\ge0 \atop k_0+k_1\cdots=0} a_{0k_0} a_{1k_1}\ldots \right)
\end{equation}
and continue your text.
