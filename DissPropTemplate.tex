\section{Project Summary}\vskip-0.05in
% Objectives and expected significance of the proposed research 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

 A nontechnical description of the project, which explains the
 project's significance and importance. The abstract should describe
 the fundamental issues the project seeks to address, as well as other
 potential benefits, such as how the project advances the field,
 supports education and diversity, or benefits society. This part
 should be understandable by a broad audience.

\section{Merit/Impact/Significance}\vskip-0.05in

 What {\it specific} scientific question(s) will this work answer?
 What is the potential for the proposed activity to advance knowledge
 and understanding within its own field or across different fields?
 Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier
 to progress in the field? Is there a strong scientific premise for
 the project? How will successful completion of the aims change the
 concepts, models, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or
 preventative interventions that drive the field? 

\subsection{Scientific Questions}\vskip-0.05in

Name the problem in the field that you will address in detail.

\vskip0.1in
\noindent This dataset/code/theory will be used to answer three
primary questions about the greatest stuff, such as: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em What is the effect of phenomena 1?}  To answer this we
  will use large experimental setup like in \citep{occam_p1} to make
  super-awesome unique measurements

\item\vskip -0.05in
 {\em How do things happen??}
We will look at \citep{binney98a} to write and develop new code that
will make the best models that are needed to answer our question.

\item \vskip -0.05in
{\em How does model X match data Y?}   
Model X as described in \citet{blandford96a} predicts that will 
have cool stuff can be measured by new exciting instrument that TCU
has recently acquired access to.

\end{enumerate}

This proposal focuses on three inter-connected projects to answer
these questions: 1) cool project, 2) cooler project, 3) awesome project.

\section{Approach/Methodology}\vskip-0.05in

How are you going to do the study?  Are the overall strategy,
methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish
the specific aims of the project? Have the investigators presented
strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate
for the work proposed? Are potential problems, alternative
strategies, and benchmarks for success presented?

\subsection{Experimental/Theoretical/Computational}\vskip-0.05in

We will ...

\section{Analysis Methods/Assessment}\vskip-0.05in

Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound
rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?
What measurements, comparisons, statistical tests, will be utilized to
measure success?  What significance level is required to provide a
measurably clear answer to the posed scientific question(s)?   


We will also include cool figures like this (\ref{fig:figuretemp}).

\section{Research Plan/Timeline/Milestones}\vskip-0.05in

Is there specific descriptions of the activities required, there
anticipated duration, and a plan in place to document the outputs of
those activities? Are there adequate resources available (either at
TCU or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?
